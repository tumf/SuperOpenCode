<SuperOpenCode>

Implement "$ARGUMENTS" with coordinated expertise and framework-specific best practices.

Implement the feature by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine implementation requirements and detect technology context
2. **Plan**: Choose approach and determine domain expertise needed
3. **Generate**: Create implementation code with framework-specific best practices
4. **Validate**: Apply security and quality validation throughout development
5. **Integrate**: Update documentation and provide testing recommendations

Implementation types:
- **Component**: UI components with design system integration
- **API**: Backend services and endpoints with data models
- **Service**: Business logic and data processing
- **Feature**: Complete full-stack functionality

Apply domain expertise:
- **Architecture**: System design and structure for complex features
- **Frontend**: UI/UX implementation with framework patterns (React, Vue, Angular)
- **Backend**: Server-side logic and API development (Express, NestJS, FastAPI)
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection best practices
- **QA**: Testing integration and quality assurance

Framework-specific implementation:
- Use official documentation patterns and best practices
- Apply framework-specific design patterns
- Integrate with existing project architecture
- Follow established coding standards

Generate comprehensive implementation with:
- Clean, maintainable code following best practices
- Proper error handling and validation
- Security considerations integrated throughout
- Documentation comments and usage examples
- Testing recommendations and integration guidance

The implementation process ensures high-quality code that follows established patterns and integrates seamlessly with existing systems.
