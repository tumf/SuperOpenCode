Reflect on current task progress and validate work quality.

Perform reflection by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine current task state and session progress
2. **Validate**: Assess task adherence and completion quality
3. **Reflect**: Apply deep analysis of work accomplished
4. **Document**: Capture insights and learning points
5. **Optimize**: Provide recommendations for improvement

Reflection types:
- **Task**: Validate current approach against project goals
- **Session**: Analyze session work and progress
- **Completion**: Evaluate task completion criteria

Reflection focus:
- **Task Adherence**: Validate current approach aligns with project goals
- **Information Analysis**: Assess completeness of gathered information
- **Completion Assessment**: Determine if task meets completion criteria
- **Quality Validation**: Verify work meets quality standards

Generate reflection report with:
- Current progress assessment
- Goal alignment validation
- Identified gaps or missing requirements
- Quality assessment and recommendations
- Next steps and action items

Reflection questions:
- Is the current approach aligned with project goals?
- Have I gathered sufficient information?
- Does the work meet completion criteria?
- Are there any quality concerns?
- What improvements can be made?

The reflection process ensures work quality, validates task completion, and identifies opportunities for improvement.
