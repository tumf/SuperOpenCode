Apply systematic improvements to $ARGUMENTS to enhance code quality, performance, and maintainability.

If no target is specified, analyze and improve the entire project.

Improve the target by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine codebase for improvement opportunities and quality issues
2. **Plan**: Choose improvement approach based on type and target scope
3. **Execute**: Apply systematic improvements with domain-specific best practices
4. **Validate**: Ensure improvements preserve functionality and meet quality standards
5. **Document**: Generate improvement summary and recommendations

Improvement types:
- **Quality**: Code structure, readability, and technical debt reduction
- **Performance**: Bottleneck resolution and optimization implementation
- **Maintainability**: Complexity reduction and documentation enhancement
- **Style**: Coding standards enforcement and consistency improvements

Apply domain expertise:
- **Architecture**: Structure analysis and design pattern application
- **Performance**: Profiling analysis and optimization strategies
- **Quality**: Code smell detection and refactoring best practices
- **Security**: Vulnerability identification and security pattern application

Improvement approach:
- Safe refactoring with comprehensive validation
- Framework-specific optimization patterns
- Systematic analysis for multi-component improvements
- Rollback capabilities for risk mitigation

Generate improvement report with:
- Summary of changes and enhancements made
- Before/after metrics and comparisons
- Impact assessment on performance and maintainability
- Recommendations for future improvements

The improvement process focuses on enhancing code quality while preserving functionality and maintaining project consistency.
