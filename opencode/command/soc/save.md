Save session context and preserve important discoveries for future work.

Save session by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine session progress and identify discoveries
2. **Persist**: Save session context and learnings
3. **Checkpoint**: Create recovery points for complex sessions
4. **Validate**: Ensure session data integrity
5. **Prepare**: Ready context for future session continuation

Save types:
- **Session**: Complete session preservation with context
- **Learnings**: New patterns and insights discovered
- **Context**: Project understanding and discoveries
- **All**: Comprehensive save with checkpoint creation

Session preservation includes:
- Important discoveries and patterns
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Architecture insights
- Implementation learnings
- Progress checkpoints

Generate session summary with:
- Key discoveries and insights
- Work accomplished summary
- Important decisions made
- Patterns identified
- Next steps for continuation

Automatic checkpoint triggers:
- Sessions exceeding 30 minutes
- Complex multi-component work
- Critical task completion
- User-requested checkpoints

The save process ensures session continuity and preserves valuable project insights for enhanced future productivity.
