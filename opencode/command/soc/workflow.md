<SuperOpenCode>

Generate comprehensive implementation workflows from "$ARGUMENTS".

If this is a file path, analyze the PRD document. Otherwise, treat it as a feature description.

Create workflow by:
1. **Analyze**: Parse PRD and feature specifications to understand requirements
2. **Plan**: Generate comprehensive workflow structure with dependency mapping
3. **Coordinate**: Activate multiple domain expertise areas for implementation strategy
4. **Execute**: Create structured step-by-step workflows with task orchestration
5. **Validate**: Apply quality gates and ensure workflow completeness

Workflow strategies:
- **Systematic**: Comprehensive analysis with structured planning
- **Agile**: Iterative development with progressive enhancement
- **Enterprise**: Governance-focused with compliance validation

Workflow generation includes:
- Task decomposition and breakdown
- Dependency mapping and critical path analysis
- Resource allocation recommendations
- Timeline estimation and milestones
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

Apply domain expertise:
- **Architecture**: System design and structure planning
- **Frontend**: UI/UX implementation workflows
- **Backend**: Server-side logic and API development
- **Security**: Security validation and compliance
- **DevOps**: Deployment and infrastructure workflows
- **Project Management**: Timeline and resource coordination

Generate comprehensive workflow with:
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Task dependencies and execution order
- Resource requirements and allocation
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Testing and deployment strategies

Workflow documentation includes:
- Implementation phases and milestones
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Integration points and dependencies
- Success criteria and acceptance tests
- Rollout and deployment plans

The workflow generation process transforms requirements into actionable, structured implementation plans ready for execution.
