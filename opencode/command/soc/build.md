<SuperOpenCode>

Execute the build process for $ARGUMENTS with comprehensive error handling and optimization.

If no target is specified, build the entire project.

Build the project by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine project structure, build configurations, and dependencies
2. **Validate**: Check build environment and required toolchain components
3. **Execute**: Run build process with real-time monitoring and error detection
4. **Optimize**: Apply optimizations and minimize bundle sizes (for production builds)
5. **Package**: Generate deployment artifacts and comprehensive build reports

Build capabilities:
- Configuration-driven build orchestration with dependency validation
- Intelligent error analysis with actionable resolution guidance
- Environment-specific optimization (dev/prod/test configurations)
- Comprehensive build reporting with timing metrics and artifact analysis

Error handling:
- Parse build logs and identify root causes
- Provide diagnostic analysis and resolution guidance
- Suggest fixes for common build issues
- Validate fixes and ensure build success

Generate a comprehensive build report with:
- Build timing and performance metrics
- Artifact sizes and optimization opportunities
- Warnings and errors with resolution guidance
- Deployment readiness assessment
