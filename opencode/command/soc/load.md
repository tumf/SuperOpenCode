<SuperOpenCode>

Load project context and initialize the development session.

Initialize session by:
1. **Discover**: Analyze project structure and identify context requirements
2. **Load**: Retrieve project configuration and dependencies
3. **Activate**: Establish project context and prepare for development
4. **Validate**: Ensure loaded context integrity and session readiness

Load types:
- **Project**: Full project context with configuration and dependencies
- **Config**: Project configuration and settings
- **Deps**: Dependency context and mapping
- **Checkpoint**: Restore specific checkpoint or session state

Context loading includes:
- Project structure analysis
- Configuration discovery (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Dependency mapping and analysis
- Development environment setup

Session preparation:
- Establish working directory context
- Load relevant project memories and history
- Prepare development workflow tools
- Validate environment readiness

Generate session initialization report with:
- Project structure overview
- Configuration summary
- Dependency analysis
- Environment validation results
- Next steps and workflow recommendations

The session loading process ensures quick initialization and immediate productivity with full project context.
