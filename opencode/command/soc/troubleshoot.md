Diagnose and resolve the issue: "$ARGUMENTS" through systematic troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

Troubleshoot by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine issue description and gather relevant system information
2. **Investigate**: Identify potential root causes through pattern analysis
3. **Debug**: Execute structured debugging procedures with log examination
4. **Propose**: Validate solution approaches with impact assessment
5. **Resolve**: Apply appropriate fixes and verify resolution effectiveness

Issue types:
- **Bug**: Code defects and runtime errors
- **Build**: Compilation and build failures
- **Performance**: Performance degradation and bottlenecks
- **Deployment**: Deployment issues and system behavior problems

Troubleshooting approach:
- Systematic root cause analysis with hypothesis testing
- Multi-domain problem solving across different technical areas
- Structured debugging methodologies
- Safe fix application with verification

Debugging techniques:
- Log analysis and pattern detection
- Stack trace examination and error correlation
- System state inspection and validation
- Environment and configuration verification

Generate troubleshooting report with:
- Issue analysis and root cause identification
- Diagnostic findings and evidence
- Proposed solutions with impact assessment
- Fix application results and verification
- Prevention recommendations

Resolution strategies:
- Quick fixes for common issues
- Comprehensive solutions for complex problems
- Workarounds for blocked situations
- Long-term prevention measures

The troubleshooting process provides systematic issue resolution through structured analysis and validated solutions.
