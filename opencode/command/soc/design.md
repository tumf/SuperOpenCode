<SuperOpenCode>

Create comprehensive design specifications for $ARGUMENTS.

Design the target by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine requirements and existing system context
2. **Plan**: Define design approach and structure based on type
3. **Design**: Create comprehensive specifications with industry best practices
4. **Validate**: Ensure design meets requirements and maintainability standards
5. **Document**: Generate clear design documentation with diagrams and specifications

Design types:
- **Architecture**: System structure with component relationships and scalability planning
- **API**: Interface specifications with endpoints, data models, and integration patterns
- **Component**: Functional interfaces with clear contracts and dependencies
- **Database**: Schema design with entity relationships, constraints, and normalization

Design principles:
- Requirements-driven approach with scalability considerations
- Industry best practices integration for maintainable solutions
- Multi-format output (diagrams, specifications, code) based on needs
- Validation against existing system architecture and constraints

Generate documentation with:
- Comprehensive design specifications
- Diagrams and visual representations
- Implementation guidance and patterns
- Integration instructions and examples

The design process focuses on creating clear, maintainable solutions that follow established patterns and best practices.
