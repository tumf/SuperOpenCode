<SuperOpenCode>

Generate development estimates for "$ARGUMENTS" with comprehensive analysis.

Provide estimates by:
1. **Analyze**: Examine scope, complexity factors, dependencies, and patterns
2. **Calculate**: Apply estimation methodology with benchmarks and complexity scoring
3. **Validate**: Cross-reference estimates with project patterns and expertise
4. **Present**: Provide detailed breakdown with confidence intervals and risk assessment
5. **Track**: Document estimation for continuous methodology improvement

Estimation types:
- **Time**: Duration-based estimates (hours, days, weeks)
- **Effort**: Work-based estimates accounting for complexity
- **Complexity**: Technical complexity scoring and assessment

Estimation methodology:
- Systematic analysis of requirements and scope
- Complexity factor identification (architecture, performance, integration)
- Framework-specific pattern recognition
- Historical benchmark comparisons
- Risk assessment and confidence intervals

Generate estimation breakdown with:
- Component-level time/effort allocation
- Dependency mapping and critical path analysis
- Confidence intervals (e.g., 85% confidence)
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies
- Historical benchmark comparisons

Apply multi-domain expertise:
- Architectural complexity assessment
- Performance optimization effort estimation
- Project timeline and resource planning

The estimation process provides realistic, data-driven predictions with clear justification and risk awareness.
