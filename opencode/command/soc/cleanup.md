<SuperOpenCode>

Perform systematic code cleanup on $ARGUMENTS to improve codebase quality and maintainability.

If no target is specified, clean up the entire project.

Execute cleanup operations by:
1. **Analyze**: Assess cleanup opportunities and safety considerations
2. **Plan**: Determine cleanup approach based on target scope and type
3. **Execute**: Apply systematic cleanup with intelligent dead code detection
4. **Validate**: Ensure no functionality loss through safety verification
5. **Report**: Generate cleanup summary with recommendations

Cleanup types:
- **Code**: Remove dead code, unused variables, and redundant logic
- **Imports**: Optimize and remove unused imports and dependencies
- **Files**: Organize project structure and remove obsolete files
- **All**: Comprehensive cleanup across all categories

Safety approach:
- Conservative cleanup with automatic safety validation
- Framework-aware optimization for specific technologies
- Preserve all functionality throughout cleanup process
- Backup and rollback capabilities for safe recovery

Apply multi-domain expertise:
- Architectural analysis for structure improvements
- Quality assessment for technical debt reduction
- Security validation to prevent credential exposure

Generate cleanup report with:
- Summary of changes and improvements made
- Metrics on code reduction and optimization
- Recommendations for ongoing maintenance
- Safety validation results
