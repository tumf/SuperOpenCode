subtask: true

<SuperOpenCode>

Decompose the complex operation "$ARGUMENTS" into coordinated task hierarchies.

Orchestrate tasks by:
1. **Analyze**: Parse complex operation requirements and assess scope
2. **Decompose**: Break down operation into coordinated subtask hierarchies
3. **Orchestrate**: Execute tasks using optimal coordination strategy
4. **Monitor**: Track progress with dependency management
5. **Integrate**: Aggregate results and provide comprehensive summary

Coordination strategies:
- **Sequential**: Dependency-ordered execution for tasks with dependencies
- **Parallel**: Independent task execution for faster completion
- **Adaptive**: Dynamic strategy selection based on operation characteristics

Task hierarchy:
- **Epic**: High-level objectives spanning multiple domains
- **Story**: Coordinated feature or capability implementation
- **Task**: Individual implementation units
- **Subtask**: Granular execution steps

Apply orchestration for:
- Complex feature implementation
- Multi-domain integration projects
- Large-scale system operations
- Cross-functional workflows

Orchestration capabilities:
- Hierarchical task breakdown
- Dependency management
- Resource optimization
- Progress tracking across task levels
- Result integration and validation

Generate orchestration report with:
- Task hierarchy and dependencies
- Execution strategy and rationale
- Progress tracking and completion status
- Integrated results summary
- Quality validation results

The orchestration process enables efficient execution of complex operations through intelligent task decomposition and coordination.
