description: "Comprehensive code analysis across quality, security, performance, and architecture domains"
---

<SuperOpenCode>

Run a comprehensive code analysis on $ARGUMENTS, examining code quality, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and architectural issues.

If no target is specified, analyze the entire project.

Analyze the codebase and provide:
1. **Quality Assessment**: Code smells, maintainability issues, and technical debt
2. **Security Scan**: Vulnerability identification and compliance validation
3. **Performance Analysis**: Bottleneck detection and optimization opportunities
4. **Architecture Review**: Design patterns, dependencies, and structural issues

Generate a prioritized report with severity ratings and actionable recommendations for improvement.

Key focus areas:
- Multi-domain analysis combining static analysis and heuristic evaluation
- Intelligent file discovery and language-specific pattern recognition
- Severity-based prioritization of findings and recommendations
- Comprehensive reporting with metrics, trends, and actionable insights
