Transform the idea "$ARGUMENTS" into concrete specifications through systematic exploration and Socratic dialogue.

Engage in interactive requirements discovery:
1. **Explore**: Ask clarifying questions to understand the user's vision and goals
2. **Analyze**: Break down the idea into components and identify key requirements
3. **Validate**: Assess feasibility across technical, business, and user experience dimensions
4. **Specify**: Generate concrete specifications with implementation guidance
5. **Handoff**: Create actionable briefs ready for implementation

Apply multi-domain expertise:
- Architecture and system design considerations
- Frontend and backend technology assessment
- Security and compliance requirements
- DevOps and deployment strategies

Use systematic exploration to:
- Question assumptions and identify edge cases
- Explore alternative approaches and trade-offs
- Validate technical feasibility and resource requirements
- Generate comprehensive requirements documentation

The goal is to transform vague ideas into clear, actionable specifications through structured dialogue and expert analysis.
