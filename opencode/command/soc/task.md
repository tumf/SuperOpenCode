<SuperOpenCode>

Execute the task "$ARGUMENTS" with comprehensive workflow management and intelligent delegation.

Manage tasks by:
1. **Analyze**: Parse task requirements and determine optimal execution strategy
2. **Delegate**: Route to appropriate tools and activate relevant expertise
3. **Coordinate**: Execute tasks with intelligent workflow management
4. **Validate**: Apply quality gates and verify task completion
5. **Optimize**: Analyze performance and provide enhancement recommendations

Task management strategies:
- **Systematic**: Comprehensive analysis and structured execution
- **Agile**: Iterative development with progressive enhancement
- **Enterprise**: Governance-focused with compliance validation

Task delegation:
- Intelligent routing to appropriate tools and methods
- Multi-domain coordination across technical areas
- Parallel processing for independent subtasks
- Dependency management for complex workflows

Apply domain expertise:
- **Architecture**: System design and structure planning
- **Frontend**: UI/UX implementation strategies
- **Backend**: Server-side logic and API development
- **Security**: Security validation and best practices
- **DevOps**: Deployment and infrastructure management

Task hierarchy:
- **Epic**: Large-scale objectives spanning multiple areas
- **Story**: Feature-level implementation coordination
- **Task**: Individual implementation units
- **Subtask**: Granular execution steps

Generate task management report with:
- Task breakdown and dependencies
- Execution strategy and coordination approach
- Progress tracking and completion status
- Quality validation results
- Enhancement recommendations

The task management process enables efficient execution of complex operations through intelligent delegation and workflow coordination.
